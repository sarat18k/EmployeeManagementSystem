Employee Management System Back-end - Spring Boot & MySQL Front-end- React

I developed a RESTful API using Spring Boot and MySQL for the back-end, tested it with Postman, and integrated it into a React front-end. CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE (CRUD) appliction. 
This repository contains the back-end of a Full Stack personal project, which is responsible for storing employee information and is implemented using the Spring Boot Java Framework which serves as the web framework for the back-end. 
This application allows users to login,logout,view, add, remove, and edit individuals within their management system.
